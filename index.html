          A couple of months back, I made a flight booking in HappyEasyGo(HEG) which got cancelled by the
          airlines. So I made a request for cancellation and refund in the HEG website and I was asked to wait for 30-45
          days for the airlines to refund the amount. Within a week, I got a mail from the airlines stating
          that they had completed refund to HEG. However, 72 days has passed and I got no refund, no reply to emails and
          no answer to calls. So I decided to take it to twitter like every frustrated customer but turns out I was not
          alone. In fact, there was someone tweeting in frustration about HEG almost every 10 mins. There were countless
          people facing similar issues but not one reply from HEG's official account. The company is clearly fraud and I
          don't they'll ever respond to us or refund our money but hey, let's atleast do something to bring this to the
          attention of concerned authorities and future customers!
